# Conclusion
The entire project has been developed and deployed as per the requirements stated by the user, it is found to bebug free as per the testing standards that is implemented. My specification#untraced errors will be concentratedin the coming versions, which are planned to be developed in near future. The system at present does not takecare off the money payment methods, as the consolidated constructs need SSL standards and are critically to beinitiated in the first face, the application of the credit card transactions is applied as a de!elopmental phase in thecoming days. The system needs more elaborative technicality for its inception and evolution.
